# TinyMod6 firmware for the TinyMod6 steno keyboard
ITC Forth in C and Forth for the AVR 32u4. 32 bit stacks, 16 bit program memory. The VM is written with Arduino Wiring, and Forth core and app are written using a target compiler written in gforth. The Forth compiler's output is a memory array that's used when compiling the VM. I hope that makes sense. 32 bit stacks meant to make this particular program easier to write.

## Architecture
This is a target compiled Forth, made in two parts. The first part is done using gforth to make the higher level Forth. It's indirect threaded, meaning each Forth word is preceded by a code field, which contains a pointer to the common code for a class of words. This pointer actually is an index into a table of functions written in C and residing in a separate memory space. Since the target application runs in an AVR 32u4 microcontroller, the program memory space is in flash memory and so is the high level Forth code. Think of the high level Forth code as data. It's in a C array of the 16 bit words. When Forth code is compiled it becomes a file called memory.h to used when compiling the C part using the Arduino compiler.
