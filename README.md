# TinyMod6 firmware for the TinyMod6 steno keyboard
ITC Forth in C and Forth for the AVR 32u4. 32 bit stacks, 16 bit program memory. The VM is written with Arduino Wiring, and Forth core and app are written using a target compiler written in gforth. The Forth compiler's output is a memory array that's used when compiling the VM. I hope that makes sense. 32 bit stacks meant to make this particular program easier to write.
